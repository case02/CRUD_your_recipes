## Your User stories:
- As someone who likes to cook for themselves, and rather than having to look through many bookmarks, I'd like to keep track of my new and old recipes on one source.
- As a working parent I don't have much time to be looking around for ideas of what to cook tonight, it'd be nice to have a place that has my favorited recipes as well as new ones.
- As a chef I'm always looking to be inspired by others recipes and finding new and innovative ideas.
