[ ] Unsolved problems:
- not very responsive, several overlaps of different divs at certain monitor widths
- certain jquery snippet didnt work as I'd like
- events seem glitchy and not smooth in transition
- styling and css are not DRY 
- too much empty space in media format
- more transitional animations and transformations would be cool
